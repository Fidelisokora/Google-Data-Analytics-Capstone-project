Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project-CyclisticPublic
For my final project, I analyzed data for Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike sharing company. Using the "Excel", I completed the Google Data Analysis Professional Certification.
This analysis is an optional case study from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera.
1. Introduction
As part of my Google Data Analytics Certification Course, i completed a final project in which I acted as a junior data analyst for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company with over 6,000 bicycles and 700 docking stations. For this project, I analyzed real-world data from Divvy, a bike-share company in Chicago, consisting of more than 5.5 million rows of data. Through this project, i gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and analysis, as well as presenting insights and recommendations to stakeholders.
2. About The Company
Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, launched in 2016 and has since grown to a fleet of 6000 geotracked bicycles across 700 docking stations. The flexible pricing plans have attracted a variety of customers, including casual riders who purchase single-ride or full-day passes, and annual members who make up the most profitable segment.
To achieve future growth, the company aims to maximize the number of annual members. Rather than targeting new customers, Cyclistic's director of marketing, Moreno, believes that converting casual riders into members is a more effective strategy. Moreno's marketing analyst team seeks to understand the differences between the two groups, identify reasons why casual riders would buy a membership, and explore how digital media can be used to influence marketing tactics.
To gain insights, the team will analyze Cyclistic's historical bike trip data, which contains more than 5.5 million rows of information. By identifying trends and patterns, they can design effective marketing strategies that promote the benefits of annual memberships to casual riders.
3. Scenario
As a Junior Data Analyst with experience in marketing analysis, I have had the opportunity to work with Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. Working alongside the director of marketing, I have been tasked with identifying key insights into the differences between casual riders and annual members, in order to optimize Cyclistic's marketing strategy and increase the number of annual memberships. Through my analytical approach, I have been able to identify key patterns and trends that have helped to inform our strategy moving forward.
To ensure the success of this project, I have developed professional data visualizations that effectively communicate my findings to key stakeholders. By presenting the data in a clear and accessible manner, I have been able to gain the support of Cyclistic executives, who have approved my recommendations based on the compelling insights presented in my visualizations.
My experience with Cyclistic has allowed me to develop a range of skills that I believe would be of value to any marketing team. As a data analyst, I have the ability to translate complex data sets into actionable insights, enabling organizations to make informed decisions that drive business success. I am confident that my skills, combined with my passion for data analysis and marketing, would make me a valuable addition to any team.
4. Key Stakeholders
Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels
5. Business Task
The business task at hand is to understand the differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders of Cyclistic bikes, and to determine how Cyclistic can persuade casual riders to purchase annual memberships through the use of digital media.
Data Source The data utilized for this analysis spans a one-year period from January 2022 to December 2022, and has been provided by Motivate International Inc. under license. The data is stored in separate CSV files, which are organized by month and can be accessed here.
6. Conclusion & Presentation
The data clearly shows a strong contrast in the usage patterns between Cyclistic subscribers and casual customers. While subscribers utilize the bikes as a primary mode of transportation, riding for shorter durations on a daily basis, customers use the service more for leisure, riding for longer durations on weekends. This insight can be used by Cyclistic to design targeted marketing campaigns and promotional offers to attract and retain these two different sets of customers. By understanding the unique needs and preferences of each group, Cyclistic can create tailored messaging that resonates with their respective target audiences and drives higher engagement and adoption of their service.

7. Key Recommendations
Casual riders would purchase an annual membership because we provide members with premium services such as a monthly discount and priority access.
By advertising on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or Slack, you can offer a 10-20% limited-time membership discount to all casual riders. They can also set up an online club for their members.
Use social media, billboards, and other electronic advertising media to highlight the benefits of cycling, such as how it strengthens heart muscles, lowers resting pulse, blood fat levels, and so on.
To convert casual riders into members, we must provide them with selected insurance incentives.
We can also create membership classes such as premium members and platinum members with different incentives or packages.
